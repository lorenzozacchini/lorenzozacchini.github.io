    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
         I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Aalto University, and my research interests are mainly in harmonic analysis. 
        More specifically, I am currently working on fractional integral operators defined on spaces of homogeneous type, and on 
        the properties of their commutators. On the other hand, throughout my studies I have had the opportunity to explore, 
        with great enjoyment, several other topics—mostly within mathematical analysis but not only—and therefore my strong 
        curiosity for Mathematics is by no means limited to my current main research area.
     </p>
     
     <p>    
        Before joining Aalto, I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Bologna.
        During my Master's studies, I spent one semester at the University of Helsinki as an Erasmus student, and later I spent three months 
        visiting Aalto University to work on part of my master's thesis. These experiences helped shape my academic 
        interests and eventually led me to start my doctoral studies here.
    </p>


    <h2>Publications</h2>
    <p>
        As of today, I have not yet published any papers containing the results of my research. 
        However, once that happens, references to them will be available in this section!
    </p>

    <h2>A Bit More About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Outside of mathematics, there are many other topics I am interested in. I tend to be a very curious person, 
    so it often happens that during the small free moments of my day I find myself reading about some random subject. 
    Among others, the topics I have been more consistently interested in include motorsport, with particular reference to Formula 1, geography, 
    vexillology (the study of flags), aviation, history, geopolitics, music, art, a wide variety of sports, and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, as is natural, my knowledge of most of these topics is rather superficial, since I neither have 
        the time nor the expertise to study them in depth and systematically as I do with mathematics. 
        Nevertheless, I find it truly enjoyable to learn whatever is accessible to me about these subjects.
