    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Aalto University, and my main interests are in the field of harmonic analysis.
        Before joining Aalto, I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Bologna.
        During my Master's studies, I spent one semester at the University of Helsinki as an Erasmus student, and later I spent three months 
        visiting Aalto University to work on part of my master's thesis. These experiences helped shape my academic 
        interests and eventually led me to start my doctoral studies here.
    </p>

    <p>
        My main research focus is harmonic analysis, but I am broadly interested in 
        many areas of mathematical analysis. As a student, I also enjoyed courses in algebra and geometry, even though 
        I eventually chose to specialize in analysis—mainly because harmonic analysis was the field that resonated 
        with me the most and captured my curiosity.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Harmonic analysis</li>
        <li>Singular/Fractional integral operators</li>
        <li>Commutators</li>
        <li>Analysis on spaces of homogeneous type</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Bit More About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Outside mathematics, I have a wide range of interests. I am passionate about motorsport, especially Formula 1,
        and I often go through phases where I become intensely curious about some random topic for a while. 
        I enjoy learning about almost any field — although at a superficial level, since it is impossible to study 
        everything as deeply as mathematics, which is my actual work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the years, some of the subjects that have caught my curiosity include geography, vexillology (the study 
        of flags), aviation, history, geopolitics, music, art, various sports, and many more.
        I am not an expert in any of these areas, but I enjoy understanding the aspects that are accessible to me.
