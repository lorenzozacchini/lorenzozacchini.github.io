    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Aalto University, supervised by Professor Tuomas Hytönen, and my research interests are mainly in harmonic analysis.
        More specifically, I am currently working on fractional integral operators defined on spaces of homogeneous type,
        and on the properties of their commutators. Throughout my studies I have also explored many other topics—mostly
        within mathematical analysis but not only—and therefore my strong curiosity for Mathematics is by no means
        limited to my current main research area.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before joining Aalto, I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Bologna.
        During my Master's studies, I spent one semester at the University of Helsinki as an Erasmus student,
        and later I spent three months visiting Aalto University to work on part of my master's thesis. These
        experiences helped shape my academic interests and eventually led me to start my doctoral studies here.
    </p>

    <h2>Publications</h2>
    <p>
        As of today, I have not yet published any papers containing the results of my research.
        However, once that happens, references to them will be available in this section.
    </p>

    <h2>A Bit More About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Outside of mathematics, there are many other topics I am interested in. 
        I tend to be a very curious person, so it often happens that during the small free moments 
        of my day I find myself reading about some random subject. Among others, the topics I have 
        been more consistently interested in include motorsport, with particular reference to Formula 1, 
        geography, vexillology (the study of flags), aviation, history, geopolitics, music, art, a wide 
        variety of sports, and many more.

    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, my knowledge of most of these topics is rather superficial, since I neither have the time nor
        the expertise to study them in depth as I do with mathematics. Nevertheless, I genuinely enjoy learning
        whatever is accessible to me about these subjects.
